  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set includes airports in the United States, Puerto Rico and the
      U.S. Virgin Islands.  The data were derived from an extract of The Public-
      Use Airports database of the National Transportation Atlas Databases-2001
      (NTAD-2001), published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics,
      Department of Transportation.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of
      these data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Data from the NTAD97 CD-ROM were obtained from the Department of
        Transportation.  Using the airport.pnt and airport.t01 files on the
        CD-ROM, airports with passenger enplanement of greater than or equal to
        250 passengers per year were selected to create a point coverage to
        which the following attributes were attached: airport location
        identifier, name of airport, name of State, State FIPS code, Air Carrier
        Activity Information System airports, and Total Enplanement. The data
        were converted to shapefile format for use in National Atlas
        applications and for distribution to the public.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        Airports for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added.
        Airport names were changed from all upper case and no period after
        initials to lower case and period after initials.  For example, LYNDON B
        JOHNSON is now Lyndon B. Johnson.

      Process_Description: 
        ATLAS_AP99 was updated with enplanement data from NTAD-2001.  Existing
        airports, heliports, and seaplane bases with enplanements of 250 or
        greater were kept in the data set, while those below 250 enplanements
        were deleted.  Sixty-five airports, heliports, and seaplane bases that
        had 250 or greater enplanements were added.  The following attributes
        were added to ATLAS_AP99: Feature, indicating the type of facility, name
        of County, and County FIPS code.
